Optimizing medical supply distribution for California counties as part of the MSBA COVID19 Analytics Challenge

## What is the Goal Here? Scope?
Beyond the basic idea that efficiently supplying medical supplies to the counties that need it to the most, people in the US are experiencing a unique effect on our capitalist economy. States are being forced into bidding wars for needed medical supplies that can mean life or death for someone with COVID-19. States are spending significant time negotiating and bidding for medical supplies, but that is only half the battle. Once they get the medical supplies, the question is, where would be the most efficient place to distribute said medical supplies throughout their state in order to minimize deaths?

The project will be focusing specifically on counties in California. California, being one the most populated state in the US, has an alarming amount of confirmed deaths, 758.  

1. Use analytics to determine the optimal distribution of newly incoming ventilators to counties. 
2. We want to minimize overall death (both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 caused)
